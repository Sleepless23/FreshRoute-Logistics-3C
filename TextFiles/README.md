Delivery Route Planning & Package Tracking System — Client Problem Statement
Client Information

Client Name: Henry Moreno
Position: Logistics & Distribution Supervisor
Organization: FreshRoute Logistics
Type: Medium-sized delivery & courier company (operating 60 delivery routes daily)

📌 **Background**

FreshRoute Logistics handles same-day deliveries for retail shops, pharmacies, and online vendors. Every day, hundreds of packages are assigned to drivers without a proper digital tracking system. Packages are logged manually on paper sheets, making it difficult to know their status during the day.

Clients frequently call to ask where their deliveries are, and the company cannot provide real-time updates. Routes are also assigned inefficiently, causing delays and increased fuel costs.

FreshRoute needs a Route Planning & Package Tracking System to optimize operations and provide transparency to clients.

🔥 **Current Problems**

Packages are recorded manually, leading to lost or mislabelled deliveries.

Drivers often follow inefficient routes, wasting fuel and time.

Customers frequently complain because they cannot track their delivery progress.

Management cannot monitor which driver has which packages.

No proper reporting for delivery performance or delays.

🎯 **Project Goal**

To build a Delivery Route & Package Tracking System that improves operational efficiency, reduces delivery errors, and increases customer satisfaction by providing clarity on delivery progress.
